# QtInstall

This is a simple installer application built with QT for the creation of setup processes

The key features are:

- creating self-containing installer applications for executables and their dependencies
- providing wizard with user feedback during installation process
- available for all QT enabled platforms (Windows, MacOS, Windows, Linux)
- optional creation of desktop and auto start links (Windows / MacOS)
- package definition done via csv files (EXCEL)

Following example shows the installation of my Automatic-Backup tool. First there can be defined a welcome message:

After this, the installation is prepared:
