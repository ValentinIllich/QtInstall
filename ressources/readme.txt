Please note the license information for the two helper applications:

SSYLoginItems       is used on Mac OS 10.5 for creating and deleting auto
                    start links for the current user. It uses the
                    CoreServices framework for managing the underlying
                    LSSharedFileList.

                    The original license is the MIT license,
                    http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php

                    Please lok inside SSYLoginItems.zip for details. You
                    will need XCode in order to open or extend the tool.

InstallHelper.exe   is used on Windows and has been destilled from my
                    other projects. It just uses the standard WIN 32 API
                    for managing desktop and auto start links for the
                    current user. It is given away under the MIT license,
                    too.

                    Please look inside InstallHelper.zip for details. You
                    will need VisualStudio C++ 2003 or higher in order to
                    open or extend the tool.
